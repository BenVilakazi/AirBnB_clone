            <p class="description">Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guest house centrally located just minutes from Gramercy Park downtown. Itâ€™s a cozy decorated suite with king bed (can be converted into two full-size beds), en-suite bath room , kitchenette & living space . The suite opens out onto our well-lit home area & spacious yard that are perfect as backdrop for your photos or just relax in our comfortable chairs next to an olive tree . We have brand new outdoor patio tables on back lawn (a glass of Merlot).</p>
